# Hi there

I'm an emerging developer operating at the intersection of **AI, Blockchain, and Digital Media**. I leverage technology to scale storytelling, financial literacy, and creativity.

Right now I'm building my stack in **Python** and **fintech/web3 tooling**, while also leveling up my **video production** workflow for comedy and digital content.

### 🛠 Tech & Creative Stack

- **Core:** Python  
- **Fintech / Web3:** Crypto exchanges (Coinbase, Crypto.com), Base ecosystem, tokenization concepts  
- **AI / Data (learning):** Pandas, basic APIs, AI-assisted editing tools  
- **Creative:** CapCut, Opus, Clipchamp, basic scriptwriting and joke writing  
- **Interests:** DeFi, embedded finance, generative AI, content tokenization, stand-up comedy

### 🚀 Current Focus

- 🔭 **Working on:** Small Python tools for personal finance and crypto tracking (e.g., monthly savings and side-hustle calculators).  
- 🌱 **Learning:**  
  - How to build Python scripts that talk to APIs (prices, balances, analytics)  
  - The fundamentals of smart contracts and how they connect to real-world products  
- 📈 **Next steps:** Ship more small, public projects that tie together crypto, finance, and content.

### ⚡ Fun Side

Outside of code, I write and perform comedy. The goal is to merge both worlds:  
**use tech to package jokes, video clips, and brand assets into real digital products.**
